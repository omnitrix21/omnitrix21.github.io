# Are Custom ROMs Becoming impractical? 

One of the many things that has always made Android such a wonderful operating system is the fact that it is highly customizable by the end user, and this has been done for a long time now through custom ROMs, which are usually used to boost performance, or to give a little more life to older phones. But by 2024, the use of custom ROMs is rapidly becoming a thing of the past due to the Google stranglehold that is the Play Integrity checks.

## What Is Play Integrity?

The Google Play Integrity API checks if the app is running on an unrooted, secure device, and the environment the app is being run in. If the device has been tampered with (i.e., custom ROM), Play Integrity will fail, and many apps (Google Pay, some banking apps) will stop working.

This new API has replaced SafetyNet with comparatively much stricter checks that are nearly impossible to bypass, even for hardcore users. Play Integrity checks app, device, and account integrity.

## Why Are Custom ROMs Failing Play Integrity?

Googleâ€™s restrictions on custom fingerprints are one of the main reasons custom ROMs fail. Custom ROM developers used to spoof the device fingerprints to trick Play Integrity into thinking the phone was stock. However, Google has started banning these spoofed fingerprints, blocking the ability to bypass these checks.

Google continues to make its restrictions stricter, and more custom ROM users are having their devices flagged by Play Integrity, which means apps won't run. Google keeps updating the API, making it harder to stay ahead with new bypass techniques.

## The Future of Custom ROMs

Custom ROMs used to provide flexibility and freedom, but with the enforcement of Play Integrity, they are becoming less practical. Since it's hard to spoof fingerprints or bypass device integrity checks, there are fewer usable apps for those running custom ROMs. Between Google's ever-improving security, the days of custom ROMs for casual users seem numbered.
